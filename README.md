# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

First goal is to have a page that assumes a hard-coded location, but dynamically updates the time of day, date, and weather conditions for the location

building backend in different repo, will reimplement most of this together in that repo as a whole app
