# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

First goal is to have a page that assumes a hard-coded location, but dynamically updates the time of day, date, and weather conditions for the location

Still TODO: update time, get precipitation, and translate the unix time into nice formats
